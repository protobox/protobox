# Protobox #

Protobox is a layer on top of [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and a [web GUI](http://getprotobox.com/about) to set up virtual machines for web development. A single [YAML document](https://github.com/protobox/protobox/blob/master/data/config/common.yml-dist) controls everything that is installed on the virtual machine. You can install [popular languages](https://github.com/protobox/protobox-docs/blob/master/modules.md#languages), [software](https://github.com/protobox/protobox-docs/blob/master/modules.md), and even [popular web applications](https://github.com/protobox/protobox-docs/blob/master/applications.md) or your [own private GIT repositories](#applications) with a simple on/off toggle in YAML. You can read more about why this was developed in our [about document](https://github.com/protobox/protobox-docs/blob/master/about.md) or on our website at [getprotobox.com](http://getprotobox.com/docs/about). 

## Installation ##

Open terminal and run the following:

	gem install protobox && protobox init

Then run `vagrant up` and follow the protobox instructions on screen.

Protobox can also be installed other ways, [click here to check out alternative installation options](http://getprotobox.com/docs/installation).

## Configuration ##

The protobox configuration file is found at `data/config/common.yml`. You can easily install new services by setting `install: 1` under any of the software in the configuration file. Alternatively you can drag and drop your yml file to make changes with our web gui at [getprotobox.com](http://getprotobox.com). 

## Functionality ##

Protobox has built in support for the following functionality:

- **Vast Module Selection**: Protobox comes bundled with 15+ of the most common modules that PHP developers use every day.
- **Application Installing**: Set the path to a git repo (public or private) or a composer project and upon `vagrant up` it will be installed for you. 
- **User Preferences**: Upon boot up, your dot files in data/dot will be copied to the virtual machine.
- **SSH Keys**: Place your SSH keys in the data/ssh and reference them from the configuration file to be copied to the virtual machine to easily access any remote servers or github. 
- **SQL Import**: You can add any SQL files in data/sql and reference them in the configuration file to be imported upon the bootup of the virtual machine. 
- **Mailcatching**: The mailcatcher package can catch any mail leaving the system for debugging and testing. 
- **Ansible**: Protobox is built using [ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/). Its simplicity, yaml format, and agent operation make for a very powerful combination. [Why Ansible?](http://www.ansibleworks.com/why-ansible/).
